Astyanax Stand Alone Client
Run Server which listens on a TCP port and passes commands to our Astyanax client.
g
1) clone the project:
	git clone git@gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de:freecookie/astyanxclient.git
	cd astyanaxclient
	mvn clean package

2) Use the our Cassandra cluster:
   git clone https://github.com/DavidHerzogTU-Berlin/cassandraToRun
   cd cassandraToRun
   ant

3) Start Server on port 2345:
		mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.c3.server.Server" -Dexec.args="2345"

   Now your Cassandra cluster needs to run

   Start Client (Connecting to: 127.0.0.1 port 2345):
   		mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.c3.client.LittleClient" -Dexec.args="127.0.0.1 2345"

---------OR---------

	Use an IDE of your choice and import the astyanaxproject then run the main method in Server.java -> Server is now listening. 
	Start your cassandra cluster.
	To Test the server you can use our LittleClient.java
	-> Run the main method and now you can give commands via the command line for example:
	write;Eric_Cartman;head-blue;body-fat
	read;Eric_Cartman;

	The server will respond with a message whether the commands were successful.
